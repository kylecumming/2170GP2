    * Feature: As a micro blog author I want to follow other micro blog authors
    * Developed By: Jake Coyne; B00775132; jc910209@dal.ca

    * and choose to follow or un follow them, which will update the db and the users page
    * This feature is implemented using a form to get whether unfollow or follow was pressed
    * and sql scripts that insert a new row or deletes a row in the following db table
    * 
    * Comments with "Follow Feature" Represent the code written by Jake Coyne
